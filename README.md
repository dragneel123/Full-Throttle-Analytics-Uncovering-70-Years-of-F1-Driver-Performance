# 🏁 Full Throttle Analytics: Uncovering 70 Years of F1 Driver Performance

Welcome to **Full Throttle Analytics**, a Python-powered data science project analyzing driver performance across the history of Formula 1 (1950–2020). Using real-world data in this project explores driver trends, dominance eras, and comparative metrics to highlight what makes F1 legends stand out.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To analyze and visualize driver performance trends over time in Formula 1 using key metrics like:

- Average finishing position per season
- Points per race
- Career performance trajectories
- Track-wise performance comparisons
- Constructor vs. driver influence
